 This repository hold a number of reuasable php-mysql files.  It can be used to copy for other projects.  
 It is set up as a web page for testing purposes currently so I didn't have to continue to get into phpMyAdmin. But could just delete/add 
 my table and data base. It also has the basic structure for _POST handling. This will be updated as more features are added.
