 This repository holds a number of reuasable php-mysql files for other projects.  
 It is set up as a web page for testing purposes currently so I didn't have to continue to get into phpMyAdmin. I wanted to just delete/add 
 my table and database with the push of a button. It also has the basic structure for _POST handling. This will be updated as more features are added.
